# DoJaject
A program to quickly make a project for iDkDoJa 5.1 to play the game on the SDK

## Build
First, clone the repository:

```git clone git@github.com:memory-hunter/DoJaject.git```

You need to have [Boost](https://www.boost.org).

For Windows XP support, place a version of [Boost](https://www.boost.org) that supports Windows XP in `/libs/` folder(you have to create a directory manually under root folder), and install v141_xp toolset.

## Usage

Use Clion (or any other IDE) with CMake for Win Vista, 7, 8, 8.1, 10, 11 builds.

Use VS project for Windows XP support.

After building the project, or downloading the release, simply drag and drop the .jar or .jam file.

***NOTE:*** **The .jar/.jam both should be in the same directory.**

Initially, you will need to give the program the root directory of iDKDoJa.
